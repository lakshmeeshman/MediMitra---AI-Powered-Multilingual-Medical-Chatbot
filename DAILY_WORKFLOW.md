## 📅 Weekly Integration Process

### Every Friday (or end of week):

#### Step 1: Merge Development to Main
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Merge development changes
git merge development

# Push to main
git push origin main
```

#### Step 2: Create Release Tag (Optional)
```bash
# Create a version tag
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Weekly release: [Date]"
git push origin v1.0.1
```

## 🔄 Feature Development Workflow

### For New Features:

#### Step 1: Create Feature Branch
```bash
# From development branch
git checkout development
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Examples:
git checkout -b feature/user-dashboard
git checkout -b feature/voice-chat-integration
git checkout -b feature/ml-model-optimization
```

#### Step 2: Develop Feature
Make your changes, commit frequently:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: [feature description]"
```

#### Step 3: Push Feature Branch
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

#### Step 4: Create Pull Request
1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Click "Compare & pull request"
3. Select your feature branch
4. Add description and assign reviewers
5. Submit pull request

#### Step 5: Merge After Review
```bash
# After PR is approved and merged
git checkout development
git pull origin development
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
```

## 🐛 Bug Fix Workflow

### For Bug Fixes:

#### Step 1: Create Bug Fix Branch
```bash
git checkout development
git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description

# Examples:
git checkout -b bugfix/login-authentication-error
git checkout -b bugfix/avatar-streaming-timeout
```

#### Step 2: Fix and Test
```bash
# Make your fixes
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: [bug description]"
```

#### Step 3: Push and Create PR
```bash
git push origin bugfix/issue-description
# Create pull request on GitHub
```

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Do's:
- ✅ Commit daily with descriptive messages
- ✅ Use development branch for daily work
- ✅ Create feature branches for new features
- ✅ Test before committing
- ✅ Keep commits small and focused
- ✅ Update documentation with changes

### Don'ts:
- ❌ Commit directly to main branch
- ❌ Commit without testing
- ❌ Use vague commit messages
- ❌ Leave branches unmerged for weeks
- ❌ Commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords)
- ❌ Force push to shared branches

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### "Your branch is ahead of origin"
```bash
git push origin development
```

#### "Your branch is behind origin"
```bash
git pull origin development
```

#### Merge conflicts:
```bash
# Resolve conflicts in your editor
# Then:
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```

#### Accidentally committed to wrong branch:
```bash
# Reset last commit
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Switch to correct branch
git checkout development

# Commit again
git commit -m "Your message"
```

#### Lost changes:
```bash
# Check reflog
git reflog

# Recover from specific commit
git checkout commit-hash
```
